# LowLevelGraphic

Basic low-level graphics program using Python and Pygame. It draws triangles using lines and animates them with rotation to create a visually interesting pattern.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pygame
* [Readme.so](https://readme.so/)

## How to Run
    1. Veryify Python and Pygame installations
    2. Run main.py
    3. Watch some cool triangles

## What I learned
* How to use basic lines as building blocks to create more complex shapes and patterns. (Just triangles in this case.)
* How simple transforms like rotating points around a center can make static shapes dynamic and move without much work.
* That even with just primitive graphics commands, itâ€™s possible to produce dynamic and intricate visuals without needing images or sprites. I imagine this as being some cool effect that can be placed behind something else to give it an impression of magic being used.
